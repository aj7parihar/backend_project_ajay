# @Getters, @Setters & Lombok
    - Accessing any attribute from outside is not possible as they are private hence we have @Getters and @Setters.
    - 'lombok' package automatically takes care of generating getter and setters.
    - We can also generate them manually.
    - Getters and Setters methods are public hence it becomes easy to set a value or get a value
        of any attribute from outside.
